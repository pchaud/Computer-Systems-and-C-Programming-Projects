# Assignment 1 directory

This directory contains source code and other files for Assignment 1.

# Program Design 

My program has 3 main parts. The first reads through the data and organizes it through 3 buffers. Then, if the get command is received then an if statement and do-while loop executes and then if my set command is received then another if statement and do-while loop executes to handle this command. Finally, an else statement executes in case all else fails.

# Bugs 

Many bugs I had to comment out set because it didn't work. Also, a lot of my test cases don't pass unfourtantley. I tried my best I underestimated this assignment a lot and I will do better next time. I also saw Valgrind/ Heap errors so there was probably poor memory handling. 

# Resources

I attended Pratik's Wednesday sections and in this he went over tips on completing the assignment which helped me build some of my program including the conditionals on when to stop my while loop in my main function. 

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strtok.htm: I used this website to better understand strtok and how to implement it within this assignment to cut up the strings fed into terminal. 

https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/open.html: I used this website to refresh on the appropriate flags for some parameters. 

I was heavily inspired by the dump_file.c file given in the resources depo for my get and set functions as they have similar functionality.
