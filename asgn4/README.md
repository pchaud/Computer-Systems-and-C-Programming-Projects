# Assignment 4 Directory

This directory contains source code and other files for Assignment 4.

# Resources 

Within the resources repo, asgn3 folder, rwlock_users, better_lock_unlock.c to understand initializing threads and using it in the context of this assignment which was pretty helpful. 

Also, I heavily used my asgn2 and asgn3 code. 


# Issues / Bugs With My Program 

I did not implement my mutex/lock in this assignment. I did not have enough time as I spent most of my time fixing asgn2, however if I could have more time with the assignment I would've fixed this and implemented it.
